Goldbach's Conjecture from a statistical point of view

Goldbach's conjecture seems to be one of those intractable problems in mathematics. Nontheless, there are numerous examples that show if you ask a harder question, you might actually be able to solve it. This is a statistical approach by considering a population of even numbers and calculating the number of ways each of them can be decomposed as sum of two prime numbers, and the hope is to make a sane conjecture based on the observations.

> This will count 12 = 5 + 7 and 12 = 7 + 5, that is number of decompositions is 2. If you want two count it once, you need to tweak it a little bit. However I'm not counting 6 = 3 + 3 twice, that is number of decompositions of 6 is only 1.
